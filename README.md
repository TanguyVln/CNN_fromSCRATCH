# CNN from scratch

I wanted to have a better understanding of how a CNN works, so I decided to do this project from scratch using NumPy. 

## Convolutional Layer
The convolutional layer is responsible for detecting features in the input image or feature map. It uses trainable filters to scan the input image and detect patterns (like edges, textures...). Each filter is used sliding in the input image and that give to us a feature map.
